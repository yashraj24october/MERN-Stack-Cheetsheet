In NodeJS, apart of CommonJS way that is using module.exports and require() to import and export,
we have one more efficient way to import and export module files in NodeJS: EcmaScript Module way.

In this way, we import and export modules like we do in react js.
that is:

For Import
-------------------------

import abc from <moduleName>
or
import {a,b} from <moduleName>


For export
------------------------

export default moduleName;


But for using this way, 
we need to follow any of two rule:
1. extension of modules should be .mjs
2. add type = "module" in package.js
if we will follow this, then we can use this ESM way of import and export
