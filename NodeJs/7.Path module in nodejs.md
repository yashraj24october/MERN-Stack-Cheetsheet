In nodeJS, we have a path module, that have many handy functions for handling path operations.
First, const path = require('path');

Functions and their uses:

1. Getting full path of current directory
path.dirname(__filename): it return the full path of current directory

- so, dirname function of path module take a parameter: full path of current file name.
then it return the full path of current directory.

	2. Getting current filename
	path.basename(__filename): It return last portion of passed location
	We can pass any location in it like __filename, __dirname.
	
	3. Getting extension of current file
	path.extname(__filename): it return extension name of file
	
	4. Joining paths
	path.join('/user',user_id,'products'): it will return complete path by joining these path.
	- /user/1/products
	- Eg: to create a new folder path:
path.join(__dirname,'folder name'): currentdirectPath/folder name

	5. Resolving any path:
its syntax is similar to path.join(), it also join the paths, but if we not add / before the first path, it will take complete absolute path, that is it resolve

so syntax:
path.resolve('path1','path2',…)
	
	6. Getting all info of current filepath like root, directory_path,basename,extension,filename.
	We have path.parse(__filename), it return object containing all info about the file path
	
	7. Checking a path is absolute or not
	path.isAbsolute(__filename/any_path)
- it returns true when path is absolute or false if not.
